# 🚀 Debrid Scout Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned features, improvements, and critical bug fixes for the Debrid Scout project. Our goal is to enhance functionality, performance, and user experience.

---

## 📌 Version 1.1.2 (Current Version)

### 🛠️ Refactoring and Performance Improvements

- **Refactor `Get_RD_Download_Link.py` into an Importable Module** 🔄
  - **Objective:** Convert the script into a module that can be directly imported and called within the Flask application.
  - **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Move `Get_RD_Download_Link.py` into the `services` package.
    - [ ] Refactor the script to expose necessary functions or classes.
    - [ ] Update `search.py` to import and use the new module.
    - [ ] Remove subprocess calls and related error handling.
    - [ ] Test to ensure functionality remains consistent.

### 🐞 High-Priority Bug Fixes and Issues

#### **1. Overwriting the Document with `document.write`** 📝

- **Issue:** The use of `document.write` in `static/js/scripts.js` overwrites the entire page, which is not the intended behavior and can cause unexpected issues.
- **Impact:** Affects user experience by disrupting the page's DOM, leading to potential loss of state and event listeners.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] **Replace `document.write` with DOM Manipulation Methods**
    - Modify the JavaScript code to update specific parts of the page using DOM manipulation (e.g., `innerHTML`, `appendChild`).
    - Ensure that the updated code targets the correct DOM elements to display results.
  - [ ] **Implement Progressive Enhancement**
    - Ensure the application functions correctly even if JavaScript is disabled.
    - Improve user experience by enhancing functionality for browsers that support JavaScript without breaking the core features.

#### **2. Client-Side Streaming Functionality** 🎥

- **Issue:** The current implementation attempts to launch VLC on the server, which is not practical. Browsers have security restrictions that prevent directly launching external applications from client-side JavaScript.
- **Impact:** Users are unable to stream content directly in VLC from the web application, limiting functionality.
- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] **Adjust JavaScript Functions for Client-Side Streaming**
    - Modify the `launchVLC` function to handle client-side streaming appropriately.
    - Explore using custom URL protocols (e.g., `vlc://`) or generating playlist files (`.m3u8`) that users can open in VLC.
    - Provide clear instructions to users on how to use these features, considering browser security policies.
  - [ ] **Handle Browser Security Considerations**
    - Research and implement methods that comply with browser security restrictions.
    - Ensure that any new implementation does not introduce security vulnerabilities.

#### **3. Exposing Sensitive Data in Templates and Logs** 🔒

- **Issue:** Sensitive information like `REAL_DEBRID_API_KEY` is being injected into templates and potentially exposed in logs.
- **Impact:** This poses a significant security risk as API keys could be leaked, compromising user accounts and data.
- **Tasks:**
  - [x] **Remove `REAL_DEBRID_API_KEY` from Template Context**
    - Update `app/__init__.py` to exclude `REAL_DEBRID_API_KEY` from the `inject_static_resources` context processor.
  - [x] **Modify Configuration Debug Statements**
    - Update `config.py` to avoid printing sensitive information in debug statements.
    - Ensure that no sensitive data is output to the console or logs in any environment.

### 📈 Other Improvements

- **Enhance Error Handling and User Feedback** ⚠️
  - [ ] Implement consistent error responses across all API endpoints.
  - [ ] Provide clear and user-friendly error messages in the UI.

- **Update Documentation and Comments** 📝
  - [ ] Add docstrings to functions and classes.
  - [ ] Use inline comments to explain complex logic.

## 🛡️ Version 1.2

### 🔐 User Authentication and Profiles

- **Implement User Authentication** 🔑
  - **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Integrate Flask-Login or a similar authentication library.
    - [ ] Create user models and database tables.
    - [ ] Implement registration, login, and logout routes.
    - [ ] Secure sensitive routes and functions.

- **User Profiles and Preferences** ⚙️
  - **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Create profile pages where users can update their information.
    - [ ] Enable users to set preferences like default search limits.

## 🔄 Version 1.3

### ⚡ Asynchronous Processing and Performance Enhancements

- **Implement Asynchronous API Calls** ⏱️
  - **Objective:** Improve application responsiveness by making non-blocking API requests.
  - **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Integrate asynchronous programming using `asyncio` or similar.
    - [ ] Refactor API calls to be asynchronous.
    - [ ] Update front-end to handle asynchronous responses.

## 🚀 Future Versions

### 🤖 Version 1.4

- **Integrate Additional Indexers** 🔍
  - **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Research and select additional torrent indexers.
    - [ ] Update the search functionality to query multiple sources.
    - [ ] Handle data normalization and deduplication.

- **Implement Recommendation System** 🎯
  - **Tasks:**
    - [ ] Develop algorithms to suggest content based on user behavior.
    - [ ] Integrate recommendations into the user interface.
