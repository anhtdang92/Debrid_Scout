            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>
                Debrid Scout uses a combination of <strong>Python</strong> for the backend and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for interactivity. It communicates with the Real-Debrid API to fetch account information and torrent data. 
                Upon receiving a search query, the app interacts with multiple torrent indexers to retrieve relevant results, which are then displayed in an organized manner for easy access.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a user selects a torrent, the app retrieves detailed file information, including sizes and available links, allowing users to stream directly or download content as needed.
